This is a random DnD 5e character creator made by Ryan DeVries for IS452.
This is a pretty basic character creator, but it will generate a Race, Class, Name, Alignment, and Stats with bonuses for your Race.

All you have to do to run this code is put it in your python reader of your choice (like Anaconda/PyCharm), and press the run button.

This will run the code and give you outputs of all the things stated above. It is totally random every single time so if you don't like something about the character just press run again.

Thank you for viewing it!
